# IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Science Team

This GitHub organisation is maintained by members of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Thematic Group.

Here we provide useful tools and resources for the classification, mapping and risk assessment of ecosystem types. 

## Guide to our repositories

We include here code-focused repositories that are intended as tools for helping user in completing Red List of Ecosystem assessments, and 
content-focused repositories providing case studies and examples.

We also include in this list several repositories with code and documentation for maintaining on-line resources.
